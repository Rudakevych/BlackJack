Welcome to the BlackJack game!

Run "main" method in class com.logos.blackJack.terminalVersion.GameRUNNER to start the game.

Rules:

A standard 52-card pack is used, several decks of cards are shuffled together. Participant attempts to beat the dealer by getting a count as close to 21 as possible, without going over 21. Card values is up to each individual player if an ace is worth 1 or 11. Face cards are 10 and any other card is its pip value. Before the deal begins, player places a bet (from 1 till 2,000,000,000).

The player to the left goes first and must decide whether to "stand" (not ask for another card) or "hit" (ask for another card in an attempt to get closer to a count of 21, or even hit 21 exactly). Thus, a player may stand on the two cards originally dealt him, or he may ask the dealer for additional cards, one at a time, until he either decides to stand on the total (if it is 21 or under). In the latter case, the player loses and the dealer collects the bet wagered. The dealer then turns to the next player to his left and serves him in the same manner.
